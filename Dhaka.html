	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>
		Dhaka municipality was founded on 1 August 1864 and upgraded to "Metropolitan" status in 1978. In 1983, the Dhaka City Corporation was created as a self-governing entity to govern Dhaka.[77] Under a new act in 1993, an election was held in 1994 for the first elected Mayor of Dhaka.[78] The Dhaka City Corporation ran the affairs of the city until November 2011.[79]
In 2011, Dhaka City Corporation was split into two separate corporations – Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation for ensuring better civic facilities.[80] These two corporations are headed by two mayors, who are elected by direct vote of the citizen for a 5-year period. The area within city corporations was divided into several wards, which each have an elected commissioner. In total the city has 130 wards and 725 mohallas.
RAJUK is responsible for coordinating urban development in the Greater Dhaka area.[81]
DMP is responsible for maintaining law and order within the metro area. It was established in 1976. DMP has 56 police stations as administrative units.[82][83]

Dhaka is the financial, commercial and the entertainment capital of Bangladesh. It accounts up to 35% of Bangladesh's economy.[19] The Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranks Dhaka as a beta-global city. The city is home to the country's monetary authority, the Bangladesh Bank, and the largest stock market, the Dhaka Stock Exchange. The main commercial areas of the city include Gulshan, Banani, Kawran Bazar, Dhanmondi Motijheel, Mohakhali, and Dilkusha. Tejgaon and Hazaribagh are the major industrial areas.[85] The city has a growing middle class, driving the market for modern consumer and luxury goods.[23][86] Restaurants, shopping malls and luxury hotels continue to serve as vital elements in the city's economy.
The city has historically attracted numerous migrant workers.[87] Hawkers, peddlers, small shops, rickshaw transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ a large segment of the population[87][88] – rickshaw-drivers alone number as many as 400,000.[89] Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013.[90]

Dhaka has rising congestion and inadequate infrastructure; the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond by the introduction of a ten-year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.[91]

Almost all large local conglomerates have their corporate offices located in Dhaka. Microcredit also began here and the offices of the Nobel Prize-winning Grameen Bank[92] and BRAC (the largest non-governmental development organisation in the world) are based in Dhaka.[93] Urban developments have sparked a widespread construction boom; new high-rise buildings and skyscrapers have changed the city's landscape.[86] Growth has been especially strong in the finance, banking, manufacturing, telecommunications and services sectors, while tourism, hotels and restaurants continue as important elements of the Dhaka economy.[87]
