Dhaka is the financial, commercial and the entertainment capital of Bangladesh. It accounts up to 35% of Bangladesh's economy.[19] The Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranks Dhaka as a beta-global city. The city is home to the country's monetary authority, the Bangladesh Bank, and the largest stock market, the Dhaka Stock Exchange. The main commercial areas of the city include Gulshan, Banani, Kawran Bazar, Dhanmondi Motijheel, Mohakhali, and Dilkusha. Tejgaon and Hazaribagh are the major industrial areas.[85] The city has a growing middle class, driving the market for modern consumer and luxury goods.[23][86] Restaurants, shopping malls and luxury hotels continue to serve as vital elements in the city's economy.
The city has historically attracted numerous migrant workers.[87] Hawkers, peddlers, small shops, rickshaw transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ a large segment of the population[87][88] – rickshaw-drivers alone number as many as 400,000.[89] Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013.[90]

Dhaka has rising congestion and inadequate infrastructure; the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond by the introduction of a ten-year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.[91]

Almost all large local conglomerates have their corporate offices located in Dhaka. Microcredit also began here and the offices of the Nobel Prize-winning Grameen Bank[92] and BRAC (the largest non-governmental development organisation in the world) are based in Dhaka.[93] Urban developments have sparked a widespread construction boom; new high-rise buildings and skyscrapers have changed the city's landscape.[86] Growth has been especially strong in the finance, banking, manufacturing, telecommunications and services sectors, while tourism, hotels and restaurants continue as important elements of the Dhaka economy.[87]
