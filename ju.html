	<h2>Location and Campus</h2>
<p>
    The university stands on the west side of the Asian Highway, popularly known as the Dhaka-Aricha Road, and is 32 kilometres away from the capital. Spread over an area of 697.56 acres (2.8 km2), the campus surrounded by the Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre (BPATC) on the south, and the Savar Cantonment on the northeast, on the north of which is the National Monument (Jatiyo Smriti Soudho) and a large dairy farm on the east. The topography of the land with its gentle rise and plains is pleasing to the eyes. The water features sprawled around the campus make an excellent habitat for the winter birds that flock in every year in the thousands and consequently, it is a site frequented by many bird watchers.[2] On 19 January 2017, the university arranged a bird fair in its Zahir Rayhan auditorium.[5] The shahid Minar of JU is the tallest Shahid Minar in Bangladesh of 71 feet in height and made of ceramic bricks on a basement of 52 feet circumferences. The height signifies the war of independence fought in 1971 and the circumference refers to the language movement of 1952. It is designed by architect Robiul Hossain.[6]

    The university is an autonomous body managed by an executive council known as 'the syndicate'. Its statutes need ratification by the Senate of the university, which meets at least once a year to do the same. The Senate passes the annual budget of the university, reviews its academic matters, and elects a panel of three nominees for the position of its vice-chancellor once every four years. the selection and appointment are made by the president of Bangladesh, who is the chancellor of the university. The chancellor also appoints the pro-vice-chancellor and the treasurer of the university.[2]
